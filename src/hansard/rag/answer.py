The call itself (the streaming, the citations as they come, the prompt cache, the retry without the fallback beta)
is the Where They Stand sites' shared model client (wts-core, ``wts_core.adapters``). What is here is what is this
site's own: which model, how hard it is asked to think, and the words around the reader's question.
