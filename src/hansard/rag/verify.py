"""Post-generation verification of a cited answer.

Claude's citations API returns, for each cited span, the exact ``cited_text``
and the index of the search result it came from. This module re-checks every
citation against our own copy of the source text and classifies every
uncited span, so the UI can show the reader exactly what is and is not
supported. Unsupported text is never silently passed off as sourced.
